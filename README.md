## Name

It was originally called colorify, but since it was a pretty shitty version of its aspiration and the countless other console coloring libraries out there. It has therefore been named colorifylog, as a temporary name.

## Colors

* Green, Hex: '#008000'
* Red, Hex: '#ff0000'
* Yellow, Hex: '#ffff00'
* Blue, Hex: '#0000ff'
* Magenta, Hex: '#ff00ff'
* Cyan, Hex: '#00ffff'

## Contributions welcome

Please add colors, improve functionality.

Here is some things you can do:
* Add background color support
