# Colorifylog

Colorifylog is a tool to color your console logs. 

## Usage

Call colorifylog and add a the Hex code.

`const colorifylog("Hello World","#ff00ff")`

Returns

![color output](./example.png "Example of color output")


## Name

It was originally called colorify, but since it was a pretty shitty version of its aspiration and the countless other console coloring libraries out there. It has therefore been named colorifylog, as a temporary name.
