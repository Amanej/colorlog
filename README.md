![color output](./example.png "Example of color output")


## Name

It was originally called colorify, but since it was a pretty shitty version of its aspiration and the countless other console coloring libraries out there. It has therefore been named color log, as a temporary named.

## Contributions welcome

Please add colors, improve functionality.

Here is some things you can do:
* Add background color support
* Add text formatting support
* Support color names instead of hex codes
* Improve main functionality to return instead of directly logging
